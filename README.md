# Movie Recommendation System Project

Recommender systems have become prevalent in recent years as they tackle the problem of information overload by suggesting the most relevant products to end users. In fact, recommender systems are information filtering tools that aspire to predict the rating for users and items, predominantly from big data to recommend their likes. Specifically, movie recommendation systems provide a mechanism to assist users in classifying users with similar interests. In this project, exploratory data analysis is used in order to develop various machine learning algorithms that predict movie ratings with reasonable accuracy. The project is part of the capstone for the professional certificate in data science program at Harvard University. The MovieLens 10M Dataset that includes 10 million ratings and 100,000 tag applications applied to 10,000 movies by 72,000 users is used for creating a movie recommendation system.
